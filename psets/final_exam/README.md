# Final Exam

Here are my final exam solutions. Solutions are in the ipython notebook (provided in [ipynb](https://github.com/vandalt/phys512/tree/master/psets/final_exam/final_exam.ipynb) and [pdf](https://github.com/vandalt/phys512/tree/master/psets/final_exam/final_exam.pdf) format). Coding problems have their own .py files, but code is copied in notebook with solutions and explanations added. The file [utils.py](https://github.com/vandalt/phys512/tree/master/psets/final_exam/utils.py) contains useful methods for problem 4.
