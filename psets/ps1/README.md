# Solutions for problem set 1.

**The notebook contains all the problems**, but I also included the .py files for each problem. 
**[integrals.py](https://github.com/vandalt/phys512/tree/master/assignments/ps1/integrals.py) contains the integrators for problems 3 and 4**.

I used python 3.7.3, but I tried to make compatible with python 2.7 (there may still be errors in python 2.7, I haven't checked).
