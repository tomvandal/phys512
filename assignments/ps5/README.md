# Solutions for problem set 5.

## Solutions for all events
**[The notebook](https://github.com/tomvandal/phys512/tree/master/assignments/ps5/ps5.ipynb) contains my solutions for all the problems**.

## Modules
To avoid making the notebook too long or confusing, I implemented all methods in these two files:
    
- [box.py](https://github.com/tomvandal/phys512/tree/master/assignments/ps5/box.py): defines a class for the box with a cylindrical conductor, along with some private methods.
- [temperature.py](https://github.com/tomvandal/phys512/tree/master/assignments/ps5/temperature.py): contains the methods for solving the heat equatino in a box (problem 5).

I used python 3.7.3, but I tried to make compatible with python 2.7 (there may still be errors in python 2.7, I haven't tried).
